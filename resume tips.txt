objective -> advertise yourself (stronger side)
* put what exactly would make you happy
* something bigger for you
* bigger for the company
* more personal
* convince them that you're their kind of person

interests and passions section -> to make up for the lack of 
professional experience (at the end)

Talk about what you think is important for development or
something personal to catch their eye

Technical skills and projects should be at the top

scratch tools maybe? probably

Contribute more to a project

Maybe take a course in functional (where you get a certificate)
